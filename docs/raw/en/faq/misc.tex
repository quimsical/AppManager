Yes. AM cannot modify any system settings without root or ADB\@.

Trackers and libraries are updated manually before making a new release.

\subsection{Are APKs deleted after installed?}\label{subsec:faq:apks-deleted-after-installed} %%##$apks-deleted-after-installed>>
%%!!apks-deleted-after-installed<<
No, APKs aren't deleted by App Manager after they are installed.

\subsection{Any plans for Shizuku?}\label{subsec:faq:shizuku-support} %%##$shizuku-title>>
%%!!shizuku<<
App Manager's use of hidden API and privileged code execution is now much more complex and cannot be integrated with
other third party apps such as \href{https://shizuku.rikka.app}{Shizuku}. Here are some reasons for not considering
Shizuku (which now has Apache 2.0 license) for App Manager:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Shizuku was initially non-free which led me to use a similar approach for App Manager to support both root
    and ADB
    \item App Manager already supports both ADB and root which in some cases is more capable than Shizuku
    \item Relying on a third-party app for the major functionalities is not a good design choice
    \item Integration of Shizuku will increase the complexity of App Manager.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What are bloatware and how to remove them?}\label{subsec:faq:what-are-bloatware} %%##$bloatware-title>>
%%!!bloatware<<
Bloatware are the unnecessary pre-installed apps, usually system apps. Some of the apps are often
used to track users and collect user data which they might sell for profits. Many system apps do not
need to request any permission to access device info, contacts and messaging data, and other usage
info, such as your phone usage habits and everything you store on your shared storage(s).

The bloatware may also include Google apps, Meta apps, and Twitter/X which can also track users
and/or collect user data without consent. You can disable a few permissions from Android settings
but be aware that Android settings hides many permissions a security researcher would call
potentially \emph{dangerous} (e.g., internet, sensor).

Were the bloatware user apps, they could be easily uninstalled either from Android settings or AM\@.
Uninstalling system apps is not possible without privileged permission, but even then, it cannot
\emph{remove} the system apps completely as they are located in the \emph{system} partition which is
a read-only partition. If you have root, you can remount this partition to manually \emph{purge}
these apps but this will break Over the Air (OTA) updates since data in the system partition has
been modified. There are two kind of updates, delta (small-size, consisting of only the changes
between two versions) and full updates. You may still be able to apply full updates, but the
bloatware will be installed again, and consequently, you have to delete them all over again.

Another solution is to disable these apps either from Android settings or AM, but certain services
can still run in the background as they can be started by other system apps using Inter-process
Communication (IPC). One possible solution is to disable all bloatware until the service has finally
stopped (after a restart). However, due to heavy modifications of the Android frameworks by the
vendors, removing or disabling certain bloatware may cause the System UI to crash or even cause
bootloop. From v4.0.0, AM has a new feature called \textbf{Debloater} which can be used as a
starting point to monitor, disable, and remove the bloatware from a proprietary Android operating
system.

\begin{warning}{Note}
    In most cases, you cannot completely debloat your device. Therefore, it is recommended that you
    use a custom ROM free from bloatware, such as Graphene OS, Lineage OS or their derivatives.
\end{warning}
